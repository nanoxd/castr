# Castr

A custom podcast server that serves up files based on a config. A soft fork of [podcast-feed-server](https://github.com/f440/podcast-feed-server)

## Usage

Create a `config.toml` file similar to [config.toml.example][config.toml.example], run via `go run main.go` or `go build && ./castr`. A server will then start up at your listen address.
